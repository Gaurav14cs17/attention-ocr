# Attention OCR

This folder contains simple tensorflow implementation of attention ocr model from paper [Attention-based Extraction of Structured Information from Street View Imagery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03549.pdf).

## Requirements
You need to install the TensorFlow, OpenCV and NumPy libraries.

## Getting Started

Show data:
```
./generator.py
```

Train model on simple data, generated by generator.py:
```
./train.py
```

Test model with visualizing attention weights on each decoding step (use pretrained model from train folder):
```
./predict.py
```
